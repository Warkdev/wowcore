This is simple wow emulator for wow 2.4.3, developing from scratch for Linux.

Currently not works correctly (Mint, Cinnamon, 18.3 Sylvia), because client stucks on 'Connected'.
Debugging with wireshark shows that client stucks after SMSG_AUTH_RESPONSE.

I'm using https://github.com/Dece/DuratorEmu, https://github.com/fotcorn/pywowd as Python examples.
Thanks a lot to developers for that projects !
